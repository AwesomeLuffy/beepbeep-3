/**
 * Simple example of the usage of Linear Temporal Logic.
 * <p>
 * In this example, we read tuples from a CSV file structured as follows:
 * <pre>
 * a,b,c
 * 0,1,2
 * 1,0,1
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * Each line of the file defines the values of attributes <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> 
 * and <i>c</i> of a new tuple. We are interested in computing the number of
 * times that a tuple where <i>a</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2</i> is followed by a tuple where
 * <i>b</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1</i>. If <code>@P</code> is the trace to read
 * from, the first condition can be written as:
 * <pre>
 * SELECT (a) LESS THAN (2) FROM (@P)
 * </pre>
 * and the second as:
 * <pre>
 * SELECT (b) GREATER THAN (1) FROM (@P)
 * </pre>
 * The output of both expressions is a trace of Boolean values, one for each
 * input event.
 * <p>
 * The pattern we are looking for can be easily expressed with temporal logic,
 * by writing
 * <pre>
 * (SELECT (a) LESS THAN (2) FROM (@P)) AND (NEXT (SELECT (b) GREATER THAN (1) FROM (@P)))
 * </pre>
 * The output of this expression is a trace of Boolean values; its <i>i</i>-th
 * event is the value "true" if, in the input trace <code>@P</code>,
 * <i>a</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2</i> in the <i>i</i>-th event, and
 * <i>b</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1</i> in the (<i>i</i>+1)-th event. Notice how the
 * expression needs to see what is in event <i>i</i>+1 before emitting a value
 * for event <i>i</i>.
 * <p>
 * Finally, we must count the number of times this trace contains the Boolean
 * value true. We can define the count of a trace as the expression:
 * <pre>
 * WHEN @P IS A processor: THE COUNT OF ( @P ) IS THE processor COMBINE (SELECT 1 FROM (@P)) WITH SUM
 * </pre>
 * and then use it to count how many events are the value true with:
 * <pre>
 * THE COUNT OF ((...) WHERE (x) = (true))
 * </pre> 
 * where <code>...</code> should be replaced by the pattern we have 
 * written previously.
 * <p>
 * The end result is a trace of numbers; a new number (incrementing the 
 * previous number by one) is output every time an event where
 * <i>a</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2</i> is read, followed by an event where
 * <i>b</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1</i>.
