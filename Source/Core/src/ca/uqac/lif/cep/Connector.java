/**
 * Provides a number of convenient methods for connecting the outputs of
 * processors to the inputs of other processors.
 * <p>
 * Methods provided by the <code>Connector</code> class are called
 * <code>connect()</code> and have various signatures. Their return value
 * typically consists of the <em>last</em> processor of the chain given
 * as an argument. This means that nested calls to <code>connect()</code>
 * are possible to form a complex chain of processors in one pass, e.g.
 * <pre>
 * Processor p = Connector.connect(
 *   new QueueSource(2, 1),
 *   Connector.connect(new QueueSource(1, 1), new Addition(), 0, 0),
 *   0, 1);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the previous example, the inner call to <code>connect()</code>
 * links output 0 of a <code>QueueSource</code> to input 0 of an
 * <code>Addition</code> processor; this partially-connected
 * <code>Addition</code> is the return value of this method. It is then used
 * in the outer call, where another <code>QueueSource</code> is linked
 * to its input 1. This fully-connected <code>Addition</code> is what is
 * put into variable <code>p</code>.
 * <p>
 * If you use lots of calls to <code>Connector.connect</code>, you may
 * consider writing:
 * <pre>
 * static import Connector.connect;
 * </pre>
 * in the beginning of your file, so you can simply write <code>connect</code>
 * instead of <code>Connector.connect</code> every time.
