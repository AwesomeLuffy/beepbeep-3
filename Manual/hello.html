<p>This first, simple example will show how to obtain BeepBeep 3 and run 
queries with it.</p>

</ul>

<a name="interpreter"></a><h2>Using the stand-alone interpreter</h2>

<p>The first way to use BeepBeep is by running it directly from the
command line. This can be done by typing:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
java -jar beepbeep3.jar
</pre>
</div>

<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<div>
<pre>
BeepBeep 3, a flexible query engine
(C) 2008-2015 Laboratoire d'informatique formelle

?
</pre>
</div>

<p>This indicates that BeepBeep has started its interpreter. The <code>?</code>
symbol is the <em>prompt</em>: it tells you that BeepBeep is ready to receive
your instructions.</p>

<p>At the prompt, type the following, and press Enter:</p>

<div>
<pre>
? PRINT ("HELLO WORLD").
</pre>
</div>

<p>BeepBeep should reply with:</p>

<div>
<pre>
"HELLO WORLD", "HELLO WORLD", "HELLO WORLD", ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>It looks like the program is stuttering, but this response is absolutely
normal. As we will see in the next section, this expression is actually the
piping of two <em>processors</em>. The first is the processor
<code>"HELLO WORLD"</code>, which creates an event <em>stream</em> made of
the character string <code>"HELLO WORLD"</code> repeated an infinite number
of times. The stream from that processor is then fed as the input of another
processor, <code>PRINT</code>, which takes whatever its input is and prints it
on screen.</p>

<p>As an event stream is potentially infinite, by default <code>PRINT</code>
only shows the first few events of its input. The three dots at the end of
the line indicate that more elements are available. To show the next element,
simply type at the prompt:</p>

<div>
<pre>
? ,
</pre>
</div>

<p>That is, a single comma followed by the Enter key. BeepBeep should reply
with:</p>

<div>
<pre>
"HELLO WORLD", ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>PRINT</code> processor showed the next (in this case, the
fourth) element of its input stream, which is, unsurprisingly, the string
<code>"HELLO WORLD"</code> again.</p>

<p>If you ever type something that BeepBeep does not understand, you will
receive the laconic message:</p>

<div>
<pre>
! SYNTAX ERROR
</pre>
</div>

<p>Don't worry, we are working on providing more helpful feedback when such a 
thing occurs. To exit the interpreter, simply type:</p>

<div>
<pre>
? QUIT.
</pre>
</div>

<p>and the program will return you to the command line.</p>

<p>Using the interpreter in such an interactive manner is useful for tutorials,
but in general, it is not expected you will use it to evaluate queries on a
regular basis. Instead of typing commands one by one, you will likely load them
in batch from a file, as you will do for the input data you wish to process.
Similarly, rather than printing results on screen, you will probably redirect
them somewhere else: to a file, through a network connection, or even as the
input to another application (as a matter of fact, you can even pipe it to
another instance of BeepBeep, which provides an easy way to distribute
processing).</p>

<a name="library"></a><h2>Using BeepBeep as a Java library</h2>

<p>The second way to use BeepBeep is as a library that you can integrate within
your own Java project. Simply make sure that the file <code>beepbeep3.jar</code>
(and its dependencies) can be found in the classpath of your project. Then, in a
way similar to JDBC, you can instantiate and interact with a query interpreter
and fetch results from your query directly from your program.</p>

<p>The following code snippet is a minimal working example of this process:</p>

<div>
<pre>
import ca.uqac.lif.cep.*;
import ca.uqac.lif.cep.eml.tuples.*;

public class MyExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Interpreter my_int = new Interpreter();
    my_int.extendGrammar(TupleGrammar.class);
    Pullable p = my_int.executeQuery("\"HELLO WORLD\"");
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
      EmlString s = (EmlString) p.pull();
      System.out.println(s);
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The first line of the <code>main()</code> method instantiates a BeepBeep
query interpreter. The second line extends its basic grammar with new
definitions for handling tuples (we'll discuss grammar extensions later).
Line 3 tells the interpreter to read a query, which returns an instance of
a <code>Pullable</code> object. It works much like an iterator, and allows you
to fetch (i.e. "pull") elements from the output one by one. Line 5 does that,
calling the <code>pull()</code> method and casting the resulting object into
an <code>EmlString</code>. The loop in line 4 does this operation 10 times and
prints the resulting element each time.</p>

<p>Note how this time, we didn't write <code>PRINT ("HELLO WORLD")</code>.
Rather than piping the output of the <code>"HELLO WORLD"</code> stream to the
<code>PRINT</code> processor, our program captures its output directly and
prints it through Java's <code>println</code> method. This ultimately amounts
to the same thing.</p>
