<p>The BeepBeep query engine is entirely written in the <a
href="http://java.com">Java programming language</a>, and is distributed under a
free software license. Before using BeepBeep to run queries, you must first
download (and optionally compile) BeepBeep. This section shows you how.</p>

<h2>Downloading and installing</h2>

<p>First make sure you have the following installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile. BeepBeep was developed and
tested on version 7 of the JDK, but it is probably safe to use any version
from 6 onwards.</li>
<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> to automate the compilation and
build process</li>
</ul>

<p>BeepBeep 3 can be downloaded from its
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/sylvainhalle/beepbeep-3">Bitbucket repository</a>.
If you have <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> installed, you can simply
clone BeepBeep into a folder by typing the command:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
git clone git@bitbucket.org:sylvainhalle/beepbeep-3.git
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Installing Dependencies</h3>

<p>Before compiling or executing BeepBeep, a number of other dependencies
(i.e. Java JAR files) must also be downloaded and installed in Java's extension
folder. Using Ant, you can automatically download any libraries missing from your
system by typing:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
ant download-deps
</pre>
</div>

<p>This will put the missing JAR files in the <code>deps</code> folder in the project's
root. These libraries should then be put somewhere in the classpath, such as
in Java's extension folder (don't leave them there, it won't work). You can
do that by typing (<em>with administrator rights</em>):</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
ant install-deps
</pre>
</div>

<p>or by putting them manually in the extension folder. Type <code>ant init</code>
and it will print out what that folder is for your system.</p>

<p>More information on the current dependencies BeepBeep has can be found in the
<code>Readme</code> file in the root folder of the project.</p>

<h3>Compiling</h3>

Compile the sources by simply typing:

<div class="code">
<pre>
ant
</pre>
</div>

<p>This will produce a file called <code>beepbeep3.jar</code>
in the folder. This file
is runnable and stand-alone, or can be used as a library, so it can be moved
around to the location of your choice.</p>

<p>In addition, the script generates in the <code>doc</code> folder the Javadoc
documentation for using BeepBeep. This documentation is also embedded in
the JAR file. To show documentation in Eclipse, right-click on the jar,
click "Properties", then fill the Javadoc location (which is the JAR
itself).</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>BeepBeep can test itself by running:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
ant test
</pre>
</div>

<p>Unit tests are run with <a href="http://junit.org">jUnit</a>; a detailed report of
these tests in HTML format is availble in the folder <code>tests/junit</code>, which
is automatically created. Code coverage is also computed with
<a href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/">JaCoCo</a>; a detailed report is available
in the folder <code>tests/coverage</code>.</p>
