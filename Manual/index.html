<h1>A Gentle Introduction to BeepBeep 3</h1>

<p>BeepBeep 3 is an <em>event query engine</em>: it receives a stream of events
produced by some application or process, and produces in realtime a new
stream of events. Internally, BeepBeep analyzes and transforms the event
stream by passing it through a chain of basic event <em>processors</em>, with the
output of one (or more) processor being piped to the input of the next one.</p>

<p>BeepBeep's language is very similar to SQL. As a matter of fact, you can
think of BeepBeep as a special form of database system: instead of querying
tables, BeepBeep's expressions operate over event streams. Depending on the
application, these streams can contain various things: name-value tuples,
scalar numbers, sets, functions, etc. The language can be extended and modified
in a flexible manner, allowing you to write very readable and high-level
queries.</p>

<p>This generic process can be put to numerous uses. Given log events from a web
server, BeepBeep can work as an intrusion detection system. When fed debug
output from a program under development, the tool can prove useful to detect
bugs. Overall, BeepBeep's input language provides dozens of simple processors
that can be piped to perform complex analysis and verification tasks over event
streams, from the generation of aggregated heat maps to the evaluation of
temporal logic properties. Users can also program their own processors that can
be freely mixed with BeepBeep's.</p>

<h2>Code Examples</h2>

<p>All the code examples mentioned in this documentation are available by
downloading BeepBeep 3's archive. The source of the software is located in the
<code>Source</code> folder, while the examples can be found under
<code>Examples</code>. Some of these examples read data from external files;
the folder contains these files as well.</p>
